                        <p>The District Executive want to understand whether there is more we need to do to make Scouting more accessible to children and young people in households with lower incomes.</p>
                        <p>We can do this by using the postcode data from OSM (for children and young people) and joining it up to the publicly available Index of Multiple Deprivation. This will show us, at small geographical area, whether those in Scouting are representative of the local population. It will not be possible to identify individuals from the analysis.</p>
                        <p>If you would like to find out more about this then please contact us using the info below.</p>
